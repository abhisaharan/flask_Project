Request - response cycle:

browser -> flask_demo.py -> templates/ -> static -> rendered pages sent back to flask_demo.py -> to browser

Session:
- After user signs in, app needs to identify page request to serve the user
- The app sets a cookie in the browser containing an ID
- For each subsequent request, this ID is passed on the app
- App checks if this ID matches with the user credentials
- If it does, app responds with the relevant info
- The process is called a session
