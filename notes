Request - response cycle:

browser -> flask_demo.py -> templates/ -> static -> rendered pages sent back to flask_demo.py -> to browser

Session: Its created in signup function in flask_demo.py
- After user signs in, app needs to identify page request to serve the user
- The app sets a cookie in the browser containing an ID
- For each subsequent request, this ID is passed on the app
- App checks if this ID matches with the user credentials
- If it does, app responds with the relevant info
- The process is called a session

Ex: "session['email'] = newuser.email"
We associated the key "email" with the user's email in order to create this session.
To determine if a user is logged in that key "email" should exist in this object. If user is not logged in
the key email wouldn't have been set and key "email" shouldn't exist in object
